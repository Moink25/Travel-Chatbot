5,1,user,Travel options best ones inside the city
6,1,assistant,"For traveling within the city of Pune, I recommend using the local buses operated by MSRTC (Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation). They are affordable, reliable, and offer a unique local experience.

Here are some bus routes that can help you navigate the city:

- Route 11: Deccan Gymkhana - Swargate
- Route 25: Camp - Shivajinagar
- Route 31: Swargate - Katraj
- Route 35: Swargate - Hadapsar
- Route 41: Camp - Pune Junction

You can find bus stops throughout the city, and the routes cover most major attractions. For more information, you can visit the MSRTC website or ask the bus conductor for assistance.

Additionally, auto-rickshaws and taxis are also available for travel within the city. However, they may be more expensive compared to the local buses."
